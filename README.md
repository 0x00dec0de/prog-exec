# Prog-exec
This is a client-side script to act as a command for running scripts that are hosted on [scripts.programster.org](https://scripts.programster.org). The reason for this tool is to perform extra security checks, such as hash and signature checks. For more information, please refer to my post  [Introducing prog-exec](http://blog.programster.org/introducing-prog-exec/).
